# CPU-OS-Simulator
Investigated deadlock, CPU register, Process Scheduling and Synchronization.
# Objectives 
1.	Understand shared global memory protection using synchronized threads. 
2.	Explain how critical regions of code can protect shared global memory areas. 
3.	Show that memory areas local to threads are unaffected by other threads. 
4.	Critical regions are often implemented using semaphores and mutexes. Be able to differentiate  these how they differ.
5.	Creating critical region and implementing this.
